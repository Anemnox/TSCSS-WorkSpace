# Exploring Software Development and Computer Architecture

This repository is a workplace and a blog on my journey to learn about Software
Engineering and Computer Architecture. It is divided into topic sections and
will include notes and projects within the sections. Though, as of now, there
is no set curriculum outlined, hopefully all of the sections will flow
naturally.
